      <h2>Scanning</h2>
      <p>
        Doing a nmap scan, I find three open ports: <b>22</b> serving SSH,
        <b>80</b> serving HTTP and <b>3000</b> stating some service called ppp.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>nmap -F -sS 10.10.11.239</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        On a more detailed scan, it shows that the port 3000 is running a HTTP
        server serving <b>Node.js Express Framework</b>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>nmap -A -sV 10.10.11.239</i>
      </p>
      <h2>Enumeration</h2>
      <p>
        Visiting the site, we find a code testing site where we can write code
        for <b>NodeJS</b> and the server runs it on a sandbox.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What is a Sandbox?</b>
        <br />
        A sandbox environment is an isolated virtual machine in which
        potentially unsafe software code can execute without affecting network
        resources or local applications. Think of a sandbox as a controlled
        playground where applications, code, and files can be tested or executed
        to see how they behave. If the software behaves maliciously or
        unexpectedly, it doesn't have the power to affect anything outside of
        that contained environment.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, the sandbox application being used here is <b>vm2 v3.9.16</b>.
        A few google searches show that it is vulnerable to
        <b>arbitrary code execution</b>. More info about the exploit can be
        found here:
        <a
          href="https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2023042016"
          class="text-link"
          target="_blank"
          >Sandbox Escape in vm2</a
        >, and the exploit can be found here:
        <a
          href="https://github.com/rvizx/CVE-2023-30547"
          class="text-link"
          target="_blank"
          >CVE-2023-30547</a
        >. The exploit hard-codes the HTTP request to get a reverse shell.
        However, the website configuration does not allow us to run more than
        one command per request. So, I create a SSH key pair and upload the
        public key to the server. Then, I use the exploit to run a command to
        add the public key to the authorized_keys file. Then, I use the private
        key to login to the server as user "svc". We are still not able to
        access the user flag. I search the directories and find a tickets.db
        file. I use sqlite3 to open the file and find a table named "users" and
        find the hash of the password for the user "joshua".
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>sqlite3 tickets.db</i>
        <i>select * from users</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        The hash is encrypted using bcrypt(blowfish). I crack the hash using
        John the Ripper.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i
          >john --format=bcrypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
          hash.txt</i
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        After logging in, we get the user flag. Then I do <i>sudo -l</i> to find
        all the files that can be run as root by the user. We find the file
        <i>/opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh</i>. On opening the file, we find that
        it is running a mysql backup script as root. We cannot edit the file but
        the password checking logic has the following code.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>if [[ $DB_PASS == $USER_PASS ]]; then</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        This line is used for <b>Pattern Matching</b> instead of string
        matching. So if we give "*" as input, it will execute. So we can
        brute-force the password character by character by using * at the end.
        And sure enough, we get the password for root as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Logging into the root user, we get the root flag.
