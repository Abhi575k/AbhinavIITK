      <h1>Sau.htb</h1>
      <h2>Scanning</h2>
      <p>
        I run a complete <b>nmap scan</b> which shows that port 80 is running
        http service, port 22 is running ssh service and port 3476 is running a
        nppmp and port 55555 is running an unknown service. What is mysterious
        is that port 80 and 3476 are filtered.
        <br />
        <br />
        <i>nmap -A -Pn -sV sau.htb</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        However, port 55555 is also serving a webpage. Upon visiting it, I found
        that it is a <b>Request Basket Site</b>. Users can request a basket and
        the server will return a unique URL for the basket. The user can then
        add items to the basket using the URL. The server is running
        <b>RequestBin</b> which is an open-source alternative to the popular web
        service
        <a href="https://rbaskets.in/web" class="text-link">rbaskets</a>. I
        initially tried uploading various reverse shells - php, JavaScript, bash
        etc., using
        <a
          href="https://www.warp.dev/terminus/curl-post-request"
          class="text-link"
          >curl POST requests</a
        >
        but none of them worked. Then I google search for any exploits it may
        have. I find that it is vulnerable to
        <b>Server-Side Request Forgery</b>. A more detailed explanation can be
        found here:
        <a
          href="https://medium.com/@li_allouche/request-baskets-1-2-1-server-side-request-forgery-cve-2023-27163-2bab94f201f7"
          class="text-link"
          target="_blank"
          >Request-Baskets 1.2.1 Server-Side Request Forgery</a
        >
        and the Proof Of Concept can be found here:
        <a
          href="https://github.com/entr0pie/CVE-2023-27163"
          class="text-link"
          target="_blank"
          >CVE-2023-27163</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Exploitation</h2>
      <p>
        The exploit uses the SSRF vulnerability to make a request to the
        <b>RequestBin</b> server to forward the request to the filtered port.
        And indeed we are able to access port 80 of the server through the bin.
        The following payload creates the request:
        <br />
        <br />
        <i
          >PAYLOAD="{\"forward_url\": \"$ATTACKER_SERVER\",\"proxy_response\":
          true,\"insecure_tls\": false,\"expand_path\": true,\"capacity\":
          250}";</i
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        This site seems to be running
        <a
          href="https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/blob/master/README.md"
          class="text-link"
          >Maltrail</a
        >
        which is a malicious traffic detection service. I again search for any
        exploits over googls and immediately find a python script that can be
        used to get a reverse shell. The script can be found here:
        <a
          href="https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit"
          class="text-link"
          target="_blank"
          >https://github.com/spookier/Maltrail-v0.53-Exploit</a
        >. It runs on Command Injection and exploits the fact thta Maltrail does
        not sanitize the input in username field. Using the script, we get a
        reverse shell as user "puma" and successfully get the user flag.
      </p>
      <h2>Privilege Escalation</h2>
      <p>
        Running <i>sudo -l</i>, we get to know that we can run
        <i>systemctl status trail.service</i> as root. On running the command,
        it prints the status using vim but it does not exit the text editor. We
        can simply get a shell inside vim which gives us root privileges and we
        get the root flag.
